# Pennsylvania Disc Golf Tournament Tracker CLI App

## Mission Statement
  Using this CLI app, you're able to have the upcoming disc golf tournaments happening in PA at a quick glance.
  Also to have the details about each tournament with just one command.

## Overview
  The app pulls data from a tournament registration site, https://discgolfscene.com, and displays the tournaments happening in Pennsylvania for the current calendar year. This app gives you a high level overview of the tournament. The name, the date, and the competition level or "tier" that it is. Different tiers have different costs to them and the prize pool scales accordingly.

  *B is higher tier than C
  *Unsanctioned will be less to enter, less prizes, usually for charity events.
  *Doubles events are played with a partner.
  *Each event will have a Professional and Amatuer side to the event. Amatuers non-monitary prizes, while Pros receive cash.
  *C/B events are one tier for the Ams, and another for the Pros. The Pros usually have the higher tier for that event.
  *X Tier are experimental events, and usually have special rules that are outside the normal ones.

## How to run the program
  Start the program by typing in `./bin/run` and the program will begin by listing out all the tournaments happening in the state of Pennsylvania.
  Then it will ask for an ID number to get the the info for the specific tournament you're interested in.
  That will provide all the details that the tournament director has listed on the event page.
  The program will exit after listing the information for the event, just start the process over if there's another tournament you'd like more info on.
